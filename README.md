# Concentration- 
AKA:
Memory, Shinkei-suijaku (Japanese meaning "nervous breakdown"), 
Matching Pairs, Match Match, Match Up, Pleonasm, Shank, 
Pexeso or simply Pairs.

Concentration is usually played with a deck of cards; however, I chose to use color blocks instead. 

This version requires the player to match up eight pairs of colors. Five attempts are granted and the player must find all the pairs before
they run out of attempts. If the player is successful then a "YOU WIN!" message is displayed, 
otherwise they will see a message that reads "SORRY! GAME OVER."

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript.

In future versions of this game, I would love to add a shuffle feature and disable clicks after win/loss.
